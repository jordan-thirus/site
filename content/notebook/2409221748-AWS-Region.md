An AWS **Region** is a cluster of data centers in a physical location (i.e us-east-1). Each region consists of a minimum of three [[2409221754-AWS-Availability-Zone|availability zones]]. Most, but not all, services on AWS are region scoped. Identifiers for services must be unique within a region. New services tend to launch in limited regions before becoming available elsewhere.

## Factors for where to launch services
- if a service is available
- compliance with data governance and legal considerations (i.e. GDPR)
- proximity to customers
	- reducing latency
- pricing
