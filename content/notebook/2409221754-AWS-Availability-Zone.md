An **Availability Zone** is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. Each data center is physically separated by some distance for disaster planning purposes. There are 3-6 availability zones per region (i.e. us-east-1 has AZs us-east-1a thru us-east-1f). Each availability zone is connected with high bandwidth, ultra low latency networking.
