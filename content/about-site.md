## Terms of Service 

Welcome to my digital garden/notebook! Here I will be sharing my thoughts, my references, what I'm learning, and just some general notes. Like the paper notebook much of the content originates from, this is a work in progress and limited to topics I'm paying attention to. To get the most of out it, here are some ground rules[^1]:

### Right to Be Wrong
I have a right to be wrong or incomplete in my notes, either due to the passage of time or incomplete knowledge.  Everything here is a living document and I will retract or rephrase things I no longer agree with. If you feel that something is incorrect, feel free to provide *constructive* criticism or alternate sources on [Github](https://github.com/jordan-thirus/site).

### Right to References
Wherever possible, I will cite sources or references that have lead me to my current understanding. If I'm not able to find the source (quite possible for some of my older notes), I will indicate that I'm not able to find a source and my confidence level in the material.

If the source is myself, I will provide an appropriate level of detail as to why I believe something or my own experiences as reference. 

### Responses to Feedback
If I receive feedback that I believe merits updating my notes, I will do such. I do not promise to respond or react to all feedback received.
